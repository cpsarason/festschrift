Activities
Free Form and Self-Organizing Except For:
Saturday and Monday: Cocktail Hours, 5 p.m., McDuff House
Sunday Pizza, Reading of the Limericks?, and Birthday Dessert, 6 p.m., McDuff House Monday Lunch Buffet and Ignite Talks, 12:00-2:30 p.m., The Great Hall, Heritage Room 1
   
McDuff House, 12 Trapper Lane, Sunriver. Parking at the house is limited to the driveway (no parking on roadways anywhere). Best alternative is to park at the village and take the paved trail south from “Circle 1”, just west of the village about 0.4 miles to the second crossing of East Meadow Rd, just east of Trapper Lane. To drive there from the highway take S Century Dr to the first (un-numbered) traffic circle and bear right on Abbott Drive, past the village, around Circle 1 to Center Dr, left on Meadow Road, do not turn on the first intersection with E Meadow Road (~0.2 miles), but continue to the second intersection with E Meadow Road (~0.45 miles) and turn left, then the first right onto Trapper Lane. First house on the right.

Little Known Facts

Ignite Talks
I’ve not had questions except how to set auto slide advance. Different people will have different versions of the software, but basically:
In the menu bar Slide Show > Transitions. Look for “Advance Slide” which is normally checked “On Mouse Click”. Change to After and enter 15 seconds. Look for “Apply To” and check “All Slides”. And have a blank slide as #21. (If you are doing something like having the same slide twice in a row either just copy it.
 
Reading of the Limericks
My birthdays are usually quiet affairs, but there has been on occasion a reading of limericks. We can read these from my 60th birthday again or perhaps some new contributions. Entirely optional.

Mark:
In fifty-one was born Russ McDuff. He used to be all the hot stuff.
His age reaches three score,
He's become quite the bore, Appreciate all of his gruff.

Fritz and Erin:
There once was a man named McDuff Who never got into a huff
That God creates wine
He took as a sign
To never accept any guff

Upper Administrator A:
When McDuff said whoa, that's enough All this crap and really bad stuff
From a bitch name of Phyllis
Who's no longer with us
So Russ is delighted, not gruff.

Upper Administrator B:
I just sent a message to Russ I saw Phyllis get on the bus. She's gone to Urbana,
He's now in Nirvana,
No need anymore for a cuss.

Photographs
Dave Butterfield asked whether I had a particular photograph from the distant past. I didn’t, but in searching I found many others that would be of interest. And I’m guessing each of you may have some too. I’ll put together a slide show of mine and if you want to add to it, send them along. No scheduled full group viewing, but we’ll have it cycling on some computer.
